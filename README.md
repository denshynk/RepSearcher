[Search_by_extension](https://github.com/denshynk/RepSearcher/blob/master/Search_by_extension.py) is a script that iterates through all the folders on the computer while looking for git repositories.
It determines that the folder is a git repository 
through the `.git` folder nested in it. Then he moves it to the folder he created or already existing on the desktop `Repositories`.
